Here is a correct arithmetical expression where each letter stands for specific digit.  
In order to set it up as the CSP, we need to introduce variables.  
6 variables { **F, T, U, W, R, O** } are obvious, and there are 3 hidden variables { **X1, X2, X3** }.  
These set of **X**s are possible carry overs and **X** can have value of 0 or 1.

  
The original variables should be all different, but hidden variables may be the same.  
Domain { 0, ... , 9 } for original variables, and { 0, 1 } for hidden.

  
e.g., **X1 + W + W = U + (10 \* X2)**

There are other examples like Sudoku, n-queens that are solvable by CSP

## Real-world CSPs

**Scheduling time and space** - meeting room assignment

-   If two meetings overlap in time, they cannot be scheduled in the same meeting room.
-   May have some soft constraints.

### Standard Search Formulation (incremental)

**Initial state**: the empty assignment, {}  
**Successor function**: assign a value to an unassigned variable that does not conflict with current assignment.  
**Goal test**: the current assignment is complete.

### Depth First Search (Backtracking)

```
function DFS(level)
{
    if (All variables are assigned) return true;// Base case
    var variable;// Select unassigned variable

    for (auto value : Domain)// Possibilities
    {
        variable.Assign(value);

        if (variable is consistent with assignment given Constraints)
            if (DFS(level + 1)) return true;

        variable.Unassign(value);
    }

    return false;
 }
```

The difference from the classical depth-first search:

-   Choosing the variable we will be working with

### Improving the Backtracking efficiency for CSP

**Heuristics**  
1.Which variable should be assigned next?

```
function MinimumRemainingValues()
{
    var result;

    for (auto variable : Variables)
        // Include cases when result is not initialized
        if (variable is not assigned and variable remaining values less than result) 
            result = variable;

    return result;
}
```
2.Can we detect inevitable failure early?

Pre-check the consistency by removing all values that will become inconsistent in the future

```
function ForwardChecking(variable x)
{
    // Neighbors based on shared constraints
    var neighbors = x.Neighbors();

    for (auto neighbor : neighbors)
    {
        if (neighbor is already assigned) constinue;

        for (auto value : Domain)
        {
            neighbor.Assign(value);
            // Mark to remove if a value in neighbor is inconsistent
            if (neighbor is not consistent with assignment given Constraints)
                valuesToRemove.emplace(value);

            neighbor.Unassign(value);
        }
        // Remove inconsistent values from neighbor
        for (auto value : valuesToRemove)
            neighbor.Remove(value);
    }
}
```
